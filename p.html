			    <b>Purpose of the research:</b> Community Notes is a collection of features on X (formerly Twitter) that allow users to write and vote on annotations (notes) about posts. The goal of this study is to better understand these Community Notes features on X.

                            <br>
                            <br>

			    <b>Eligibility</b>:
			     You are eligible to participate in this study if you meet the following requirements.
			    <br>
			    <br>
			    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px; padding-left: 20px;">
			    <li>You are at least 18 years old.</li>
			    <li>You are located in the United States.</li>
			    <li>You have an account on X.</li>
			    <li>You have signed up for the Community Notes program on X. <br>Please note that this is an additional step. X accounts are not automatically signed up for Community Notes.</b></li>
			    <li>You have previously participated in the first part of this study.</li>
			    <li>You are able to download your account data on X. If you have not yet received a notification from X that your account data is available, please wait for that notification before beginning this part of the study.</li>
			    </ul>
			    <br>

                            <b>Expected Duration:</b> 
			    We anticipate that completing this phase of the study will take approximately 25 minutes.

                            <b>Study Procedures:</b> 
			    In this follow-up part of the study, we will ask you to complete a survey about yourself, including your experiences with Community Notes and perspectives on current events. We will also ask you to submit information derived from your X account data. Additional detail about the information that we will ask you to submit is available here [link], and you will have an opportunity to review this information before you submit. We will analyze your survey responses and X information to better understand Community Notes, including by matching your information to public de-identified data about your Community Notes activity.
                            <br>
                            <br>
